This project is partly a fork of the brilliant [family chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart/tree/master), and i am very sorry to the contributors to the project for what i have done to their code.

I ~~needed~~ wanted a family tree chart that could keep track of very convoluted and incestuous lineages (dont ask). So i wrote while staying up wayyyy to late at night to think properly, and not caring about future maintainability or usability at all.

The code is a mess, it barley functions, and i will not bother documenting it at all. If you ever end up needing this, god help your soul
